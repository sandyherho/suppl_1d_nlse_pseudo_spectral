Space-Time Pattern Analysis:

PATTERN CHARACTERISTICS:
========================

1. Single Soliton:
   - Diagonal stripe indicates constant velocity propagation
   - Uniform intensity along trajectory shows shape preservation
   - No dispersion demonstrates soliton stability
   - Energy center (white dashed line) follows soliton peak

2. Two-Soliton Collision:
   - Two diagonal stripes crossing form X-pattern
   - Intensity enhancement at collision point
   - Post-collision: solitons retain individual identity
   - Phase shift visible as trajectory displacement

3. Breather Solution:
   - Vertical stripes show stationary position
   - Intensity modulation creates breathing pattern
   - Periodic bright/dark regions in time
   - Energy center remains localized

4. Modulation Instability:
   - Initial uniform background breaks up
   - Vertical striations indicate pattern formation
   - Bright spots represent rogue wave formation
   - Wavelength determined by most unstable mode

PHYSICAL MECHANISMS:
====================

Key Features:
- Stripe slope → propagation velocity
- Stripe width → spatial extent of solution
- Intensity variations → energy redistribution
- Pattern formation → nonlinear dynamics

Conservation Laws:
- Energy conservation visible in intensity patterns
- Momentum conservation in soliton trajectories
- Phase coherence in regular patterns
- Nonlinear selection of dominant modes

DIAGNOSTIC VALUE:
================

The space-time visualization provides:
- Direct observation of wave propagation
- Collision and interaction dynamics
- Pattern formation mechanisms
- Quantitative velocity measurements
- Energy localization and redistribution
- Stability and instability regions
